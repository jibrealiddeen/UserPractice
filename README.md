# 🔐 Python Password Generator

This is a beginner-friendly password generator built with Python. It interacts with the user to create a strong, random password based on a chosen length — with extra style using loading bars! 😎

---

## 📌 Features

- Asks for user input and name
- Validates password length (must be 10–20 characters)
- Cool loading bars using:
  - `alive-progress` (startup)
  - `tqdm` (step-by-step load)
  - Custom text-based progress bar with `?` and `-`
- Generates strong random passwords with:
  - Uppercase + lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols (!@#$%^&*)
